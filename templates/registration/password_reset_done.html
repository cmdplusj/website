              We've emailed you instructions for setting your password, if an account exists with the email you entered.
              You should receive them shortly.
            </p>
            <p>Didn't get an email yet?</p>
            <p>If you don't see an email from us in a few minutes, a few things could've happened:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>The email took a detour to your spam folder.</p></li>
                <li><p>The email you typed-in had a typo. (Happens to the best of us.)/p></li>
                <li><p>Accidentally gave your work or personal email instead of the one you intended.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you still haven't gotten the email though, drop us an email at cmdplusj@gmail.com and get right on it.</p>
